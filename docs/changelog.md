## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 0.2.x to 0.3.x

The main breaking changes in 0.3.x are:

1. **Function naming**: `map_parallel` â†’ `parallel_map`
   ```python
   # Old (0.2.x)
   from pyferris import map_parallel
   results = map_parallel(func, data)
   
   # New (0.3.x)
   from pyferris import parallel_map
   results = parallel_map(func, data)
   ```

2. **Executor interface**: New class-based approach
   ```python
   # Old (0.2.x)
   from pyferris import execute_parallel
   results = execute_parallel(tasks, workers=4)
   
   # New (0.3.x)
   from pyferris import Executor
   with Executor(max_workers=4) as executor:
       results = executor.map(func, data)
   ```

3. **Configuration**: New structured configuration
   ```python
   # Old (0.2.x)
   import pyferris
   pyferris.set_workers(4)
   pyferris.set_chunk_size(100)
   
   # New (0.3.x)
   from pyferris import Config
   config = Config(max_workers=4, chunk_size=100)
   # Pass config to operations as needed
   ```

### Migrating from 0.1.x to 0.2.x

Major API redesign in 0.2.x:

1. **Import structure**: Consolidated imports
   ```python
   # Old (0.1.x)
   from pyferris.core import parallel_map
   from pyferris.executor import Executor
   
   # New (0.2.x+)
   from pyferris import parallel_map, Executor
   ```

2. **Error handling**: New exception types
   ```python
   # Old (0.1.x)
   try:
       results = parallel_map(func, data)
   except Exception as e:
       # Generic exception handling
       
   # New (0.2.x+)
   from pyferris import PyFerrisError, WorkerError
   try:
       results = parallel_map(func, data)
   except WorkerError as e:
       # Handle worker-specific errors
   except PyFerrisError as e:
       # Handle other PyFerris errors
   ```

## Support Policy

- **Latest major version** (0.3.x): Full support with new features and bug fixes
- **Previous major version** (0.2.x): Security fixes and critical bug fixes only
- **Older versions** (0.1.x): No longer supported

We recommend upgrading to the latest version for the best performance and security.
