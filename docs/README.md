## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start Example

```python
import pyferris.simple_io as sio

# Write a file
sio.write_file("hello.txt", "Hello, Pyferris!")

# Read it back
content = sio.read_file("hello.txt")
print(content)  # Output: Hello, Pyferris!

# Process multiple files in parallel
files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"]
contents = sio.read_files_parallel(files)

# Clean up
sio.delete_file("hello.txt")
```
